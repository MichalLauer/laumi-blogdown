      I enjoy working with data in all sorts of ways. Extracting data from
      various sources and combining them is an art I enjoy practicing. Your
      data will be wrangled, visualized, and analyzed in a clear and effective
      way. I believe in a scientific and evidence-based approach
      to data analysis, which is why all my models, practices, and statistical
      methods have roots in academic literature and the scientific world.

      I like to explore the R world and everything it has to offer - from
      creating websites using blogdown, through well-documented analysis using
      R Markdown, to interactive dashboards with Shiny. I strive to learn
      every day something new so my work is always up-to-date with the latest
      standards, practices, and packages.
