      I am a student who is enthusiastic about statistics, data, R, and other
      related domains. The magic of numbers has always amazed me
      , and it's one of my great life passions. While studying, I realized
      that Statistics combines all things that are meaningful to me, and ever
      since, I have been determined to learn as much as possible.

      My work experience lies in the more technical side of data analytics, like
      pipeline maintenance, dashboard management, data cleaning, or reporting
      in excel. I'm keen on gaining more experience with analytics,
      using statistics in practice, and dipping into the scientific world.
